### Case

The tourism sector is a driving contributor to a country's economy. In 2019, tourism accounted for 5% of Indonesia's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The tourism sector is closely related to hospitality. When the occupancy rate or hotel occupancy increases, this will have an impact on increasing the revenue of the area. However, there is one problem that is often faced by hotels that will affect occupancy, namely the problem of hotel room reservations.

Based on that, predictions are made on the likelihood that customers will cancel the reservation or not. It is hoped that the resulting modeling can assist the hotel in understanding how many customers are predicted to cancel the reservation, and why they cancel it, and so that the hotel can prepare a mitigation plan to continue to increase hotel room occupancy.

### Requirement

Not have a specific requirement. Only analysis what I do to solve that case.
